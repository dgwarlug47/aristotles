CRITICAL: It has to be the excess of deficiency of one of these 14 virtues. The hamartia can only be one of these 28 options.

'Courage deficiency'

'Temperance deficiency'

Art / Craft (Skill)

2. **Context**: The specific situation or environment where this flaw causes the most problems. It should be at most two words with a greek translation in the latin alphabet.
3. **Phronesis Level**: Their practical wisdom level in one word (low/medium/high)
4. **Phronesis Trajectory**: How their wisdom changes in one word (increasing/decreasing/constant)
5. **Telos**: Their ultimate purpose, goal, or what they're striving toward
6. **Universe**: The fictional universe, story world, or source material they come from (e.g., "Marvel Universe", "Harry Potter", "Game of Thrones", "  World war 2")
7. **Greatest Win**: A specific victory where their traits served them well, the response should be around three sentences
8. **Greatest Defeat**: A specific failure directly caused by their hamartia, the response should be around three sentences
9. **Tags**: 3-5 categorization tags (e.g., anime, literature, history, science etc.) - THIS FIELD IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE INCLUDED


Here is an example response

{
  "characterName": "Hitler",
  "hamartia": "Excessive Ambition",
  "context": "War", 
  "phronesisLevel": "High",
  "phronesisTrajectory": "Decreasing",
  "telos": "Stablish a racially defined totalitarian empire dominated by what he considered the "Aryan" or "Germanic" race.",
  "universe": "World War 2",
  "greatestWin": "Hitler's rise to power in Germany exemplified his ability to exploit the economic and political instability of the Weimar Republic. Through his charismatic oratory and manipulative propaganda, he successfully consolidated power and garnered mass support.",
  "greatestDefeat": "His hubris led to the disastrous decision to invade the Soviet Union, underestimating both the resilience of the Russian people and the logistical challenges posed by the harsh winter. This miscalculation not only marked the turning point of the war but also significantly weakened his military position.",
  "tags": ["War", "History"]
}

{
  "characterName": "Achilles",
  "hamartia": "Patience Deficiency",
  "context": "Trojan War conflict with Agamemnon and the Trojans",
  "phronesisLevel": "Medium",
  "phronesisTrajectory": "Constant",
  "telos": "Sought eternal glory and honor on the battlefield, but his inability to temper anger diverted him from the common good of his army.",
  "universe": "Greek Mythology (Homer's Iliad)",
  "greatestWin": "Defeated Hector in single combat, avenging Patroclus and securing his place as the greatest warrior of the Greeks.",
  "greatestDefeat": "His rage-driven refusal to fight after Agamemnon's insult cost many Greek lives, and his wrathful excess led to desecrating Hector‚Äôs body ‚Äî staining his honor.",
  "tags": ["Mythology", "Tragedy"]
}


Be specific and insightful. Focus on how their hamartia manifests in their context and how it leads to both their greatest triumph and downfall.

CRITICAL: Your response must follow the EXACT same format, structure, length, and style as the Hitler example above. Match the conciseness of "Excessive Ambition" for hamartia, "War" for context, the length of the telos statement, and especially the three-sentence format for greatestWin and greatestDefeat.

MANDATORY: Include the "tags" field with exactly 3-5 relevant categorization tags. DO NOT omit this field.

Return your analysis as a JSON object with the exact structure I specified, formatted identically to the template.`;
